# kube-deploy-trace
# Kubernetes Cluster Deployment Tracker

This project consists of two Python scripts designed to trace and visualize the deployment process of Kubernetes clusters or applications deployed within a Kubernetes environment. These tools help monitor the status of your pods in real time and provide a graphical representation of their deployment progress.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `kubernetes_timeline_prase.py`
This script processes the output of the `kubectl get pod -w` command and organizes the data into a structured format. It performs the following tasks:
- Cleans and filters the raw log output to include only relevant pod information.
- Parses the pod status updates into a structured list.
- Categorizes pods into sections based on their namespace and name.
- Calculates start and end times for each pod's status, enabling time-based analysis of deployment progress.
- Outputs the processed data into a structured file (`processed_pods.txt`).

### 2. `kubernetes_timeline_show.py`
This script uses the data produced by `kubernetes_timeline_prase.py` to create a visual timeline of the deployment process:
- Reads the structured data from `processed_pods.txt`.
- Generates a Gantt chart-like visualization using the `matplotlib` library.
- Represents pod statuses with distinct colors for clarity (e.g., `Running` in green, `Error` in red).
- Groups pods by sections and displays their progress over time.

## Use Cases
- **Kubernetes Deployment Tracking**: Monitor the progress of cluster component initialization and application deployment in Kubernetes.
- **Visualization of Application Deployments**: Analyze the deployment times and statuses of various components or services within your Kubernetes environment.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` library installed (`pip install matplotlib`)

## Usage
1. Run the `kubernetes_timeline_prase.py` script with the log file generated by `kubectl get pod -w`:
   ```bash
   python kubernetes_timeline_prase.py
   
Ensure the input log file is named timeline.log or modify the script to match your filename.

2. Use the output file processed_pods.txt as input for the visualization script:
   ```bash
   python kubernetes_timeline_show.py
   
The script will display a visual timeline of the deployment process.
